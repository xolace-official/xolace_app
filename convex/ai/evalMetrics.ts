// =============================================================
// EVAL METRICS — Cognition Layer Phase 4, Loop #4 (eval harness).
//
// The online north-star: confirmation rate per prompt/model version. The
// version-stamping discipline from every prior loop (mirrorModelVersion,
// toneUsed) pays off here — this is the pure aggregation that turns those
// stamps into a comparable quality signal, so "did the new articulator prompt
// land better than the old one?" becomes an answerable question instead of a
// vibe.
//
// This module is intentionally pure and model-free: no re-derivation, no LLM
// call (constitution rule) — it only counts terminal verdicts the pipeline
// already recorded. The Convex queries in ../evals.ts feed it rows read
// straight off the `by_model_version` / `by_date` indexes.
//
// Metric semantics (mirrors Loop #3's read of which states carry signal):
//   confirmed → the mirror landed on the first try (the thing we want).
//   refined   → it landed, but only after the user corrected it.
//   gave_up   → it never landed; the user proceeded anyway.
//   abandoned → the user left during the mirror stage. Ambiguous (a wrong
//               mirror vs. life interrupting), so it is counted and reported
//               but EXCLUDED from the quality denominators — same treatment
//               `episodicImportance` gives it (a noisy, non-actionable state).
//
// Two rates, both over the "judged" set (confirmed + refined + gave_up):
//   firstTryRate = confirmed / judged   — precision of the first read.
//   landingRate  = (confirmed+refined)/judged — did it get there at all.
// abandonRate = abandoned / total is reported separately as an engagement
// caveat, never folded into quality.
