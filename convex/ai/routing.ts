// =============================================================
// CLAIM STRENGTH ROUTING — Cognition Layer Phase 4, Loop #2.
//
// System 1 (the hot path) stays deterministic forever (decision-log #8):
// this is rule-code, never a model call. It decides how strongly the mirror
// may claim tonight's read — and, when there isn't enough signal to earn a
// read at all, that it should say so instead of asserting one.
//
//   reaching  → the gate fired and no reach has gone out on this session:
//               name what is present, then say plainly that what it attaches
//               to is not in the words yet.
//   holding   → the reach already went out and the signal is still faint, or
//               the session hit the cap having reached.
//   measured  → the normal path.
//   confident → high confidence AND high shape: full precision, no hedging.
//
// The gate (docs/confidence-aware-mirroring.md §3) is:
//
//   reach = specificity <= 2 && !memoryConnected && eligibleEntryType
//        && !isEscalation && !profileAlreadyReachedToday
//
// `confidence` is deliberately NOT in the conjunct (§3.2): the classifier's
// self-reported confidence is a discrete menu, so any threshold there is a
// tripwire a prompt revision can trip. It is kept only on the `confident`
// pole, which works.
//
// Claim strength is never persisted — it is a pure function of the
// Understanding plus session state, so it is re-derived wherever needed.
