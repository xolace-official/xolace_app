 * Kindling action catalog (docs/paths-v1.md §3.1, #331). Action TYPES in

 * a key; the binder (§2.3, #332) turns a key into concrete content.
 *
 * Audio and music are FAMILIES: one entry per topic, never per track. The
 * `topic` on each entry matches `audio_tracks.topic` — it is the join key the
 * binder uses. "The Spectrum" episodes ride the `audio_topic_*` entries and
 * compete with standalones on tags — `tier` is editorial, never a binding
 * gate; only Track 2 gets its own cross-topic key, `episode_reframe`.
