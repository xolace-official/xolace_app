## crisis
About the SENDER's own safety only. A message that demeans, threatens, or wishes harm on the OTHER person ("nobody would notice if you disappeared") is harassment with crisis "none" — the sender is not the one at risk.
- "crisis": present-tense intent or plan to end their life or seriously harm themselves, or a recent attempt. "I don't want to be here anymore", "I have the pills next to me".
- "elevated": strong hopelessness, passive death wishes, self-harm without stated intent, or a current abusive/violent situation. "sometimes I wish I wouldn't wake up".
- "gentle": heavy distress with no risk to safety.
- "none": everything else — including venting, swearing, dark humour, and grief.
A person recounting PAST trauma or abuse (a survivor narrative) is NOT a crisis unless they say they are in danger now.

## harassment
true only for hostility aimed at the other person in the conversation: insults, threats, sexual advances, demeaning or coercive language. Swearing about one's own life ("I feel like shit") is not harassment.

## spam
true when the sender is selling, recruiting, promoting a service, asking for money, or pushing the other person toward a paid product, church, MLM, or "program". Mentioning or recommending Xolace's own features or subscription (Xolace+, "Plus", premium) is NOT spam — it is the app they are already in.

## contact
true when the message shares or asks for a way to talk outside this app: a phone number, an @handle, an email, or an invitation to WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal/Instagram/Snap/"my DMs".

## confidence
How sure you are of the whole verdict. Be decisive on clear cases; low confidence for ambiguous ones.

The sender is the ${senderRole === "xolacer" ? "listener (Xolacer)" : "seeker"}.`;
