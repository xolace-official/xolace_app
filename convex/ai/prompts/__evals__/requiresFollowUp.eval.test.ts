/**
 * Live-Haiku eval for the classifier's `requiresFollowUp` flag.
 *
 * Run: `bun test convex/ai/prompts/__evals__/requiresFollowUp.eval.ts`
 * Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (bun auto-loads .env.local). Skips cleanly when
 * the key is absent so CI without secrets stays green.
 *
 * This is a calibration eval, not a unit test — it calls the real model. A
 * couple of borderline misses are acceptable signal, not a hard failure; the
 * suite asserts overall accuracy >= 0.8 across the labeled set plus exact
 * correctness on the unambiguous anchors.
