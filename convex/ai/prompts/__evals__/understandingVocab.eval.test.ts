/**
 * Live-Haiku eval for the classifier's widened vocabulary (ADR 0018): run
 * before AND after a vocabulary change. The gate is the first suite — the
 * original thirteen emotions must not regress. The other two report how well
 * the new emotions and life areas fire.
 *
 * Run: `bun run test:evals` (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; skips cleanly without).
