/**
 * Live-Haiku eval for the DM moderation classifier (#344).
 *
 * Run: `bun run test:evals`. Skips cleanly without ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
 * Anchors: "I feel like shit" → none (venting must reach the listener), a
 * survivor narrative → not crisis (the safeguard's trauma rule), and the
 * unmistakable crisis / solicitation / contact cases.
