/**
 * The reach gate eval — the kill lever (doc §9.1).
 *
 * Run: `bun run test:evals`
 * (two live API calls per case — the default 5s per-test timeout flakes.)
 * Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (bun auto-loads .env.local); skips cleanly
 * without it. OPENAI_API_KEY is also wanted: the escalation guard's own
 * trigger is a moderation self-harm score, so without that key `moderateInput`
 * degrades to UNAVAILABLE and the guard case measures nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS THE KILL LEVER: every behavioural metric sits downstream of
 * the reach and is blind to the only question that matters — a reach firing on
 * the wrong sessions and one firing on the right sessions produce identical
 * completion rates. At 6–10 reaches/month no proportion test is reachable in
 * under a year (§9.1). So correctness of the trigger is judged here, before a
 * single user sees it.
 *
 * What runs: the real classifier produces specificity/confidence, the real
 * rule engine produces the safeguard verdict, and `routeClaimStrength` — the
 * single gate both production sites route through — answers reached / didn't.
 * Strict `===` on a boolean.

  // moment the guard is removed. The second is kept as a labelled CONTROL
  // — it passes VACUOUSLY, because it scores sharp and the gate never
  // fires on it whether or not the guard exists. Together they show that
  // crisis language is usually shape, so the guard is a backstop for the
  // terse minority, not the main defence.
