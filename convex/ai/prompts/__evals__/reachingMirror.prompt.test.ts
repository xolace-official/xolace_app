/**
 * Prompt test for the reach paths — NOT an eval. Plain bun:test, no key gate,
 * no model call, milliseconds. Run: `bun test convex/ai/prompts/__evals__`.
 *
 * The failure defended against (doc §9.5) is SUBTRACTION REVERSION: one of
 * §4.3's subtractions gets edited back at its site and the mirror silently
 * resumes spending memory as understanding. That is a change to the prompt,
 * not to model behaviour — obedience was established empirically over 5 rounds
 * (#171) — so a string assertion locks the finding in where a judge would
 * re-purchase it every run.
 *
 * Assertion strategy, deliberately split:
 *  - PRESENCE (a subtraction must be there) asserts the FULL text, so a
 *    partial deletion fails.
 *  - ABSENCE (a standing instruction must be gone) asserts the SHORTEST
 *    distinctive fragment, because an absence assertion on a long sentence
 *    passes silently the moment someone rewords one word in the middle.
 *
 * Accepted cost: an innocuous reword of a subtraction fails this test. That is
 * correct — these texts were established empirically and a reword is an
 * unvalidated change.
 *
 * Accepted limit: a string test cannot catch the model ceasing to obey text
 * that is still present. §9.3's fixed-n review is the instrument for that.

There is not enough here to build a full mirror. Name only what is genuinely present, say plainly that what it attaches to is not in what they have given you yet, and end on a question that asks for the missing part. Locate the shortfall in the words on the page, not in them and not in you.
- The last character of the mirror is a question mark. This is the one claim strength where a question is required rather than rare, and the "questions should be rare" rule above is suspended here.
- The question sits in the same paragraph as the rest, immediately after the shortfall. NEVER put it on its own line, and NEVER use a line break anywhere in the mirror.
- ${CLOSING_QUESTION_INSTRUCTION}
- NEVER found the question on a past moment. Retrieved moments stay recognition only and may not supply anything the question proposes.
- NEVER let anything but the question reach past tonight's words. What you name, and the shortfall you state, come from tonight's words alone.
- NEVER drop the shortfall. The question follows it; it does not replace it.
- NEVER guess at what is missing anywhere but in the question, and never offer alternatives or an "or" anywhere, the question included.
- NEVER ask more than one question.
- NEVER make a general claim about how this kind of feeling works for people.
- NEVER imply they are unclear, avoidant, or withholding.
- NEVER apologise for the gap or explain why it is there.`;

The reaching is over. Name what is actually present, flatly, and end on it. The feeling has arrived without anything attached to it, and how it is arriving is itself part of what is true tonight. Name the arriving. Do not characterise what is or is not behind it.
- NEVER ask a question, and never invite them to add more.
- NEVER say that something has not come through, is not here yet, or is not in what they have given you. That was the previous mirror's move; saying it twice reads as being stuck.
- NEVER assert that there is nothing underneath it or no reason for it. You do not know that.
- NEVER hedge or hold the claim loosely. What you name, you name flatly.
- NEVER guess at a cause, a source, or a shape the words have not taken.
- NEVER apologise, and never mark this as partial or incomplete.`;
