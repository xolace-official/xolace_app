/**
 * Live-Haiku eval for the classifier's `supportNeed` grade
 * (docs/paths-v1.md §1 — the kindling trigger).
 *
 * Run: `bun run test:evals`
 * Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (vitest.config.ts loads .env.local). Skips cleanly when
 * the key is absent so CI without secrets stays green.
 *
 * Ordinal grading eval, not a unit test — it calls the real model. A
 * near-miss (off by one grade) is acceptable signal; exact match on the
 * unambiguous anchors is not.
