/**
 * The steadiness-insight quality gate (#525, #526, ADR 0019). Failure modes:
 * an insight shown that cites under two sessions, a burned or someone else's
 * session, or sessions that never touched its domains; one a template could
 * write (restating the score, "came up in 6 of 10 sessions"); generic comfort;
 * a sensitive life area or clinical label; one contradicting the score's
 * direction. And the #526 bar: a log recap (a list of dates, a string of their
 * own quotes, a restated count) or a mirror-style reframe of one moment (its
 * sessions bunched in a single week) passing as a revelation; an overall
 * insight resting on one domain; a "what you say vs after" with no check-ins
 * behind it; "where relief came from" citing nothing that ended lighter.
 *
 * shownNow (read time): an insight shown before its domains unlock, one
 * leaning on "your usual" before the domain settles, or one left beside a
 * score that has since moved past its reliable-change band.
