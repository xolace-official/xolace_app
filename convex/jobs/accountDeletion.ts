 * it takes. This function deliberately owns no per-user deletion logic —
 * a single mutation cannot bound a user with thousands of sessions.
 *
 * Each selected user is claimed (flipped "deleted" → "purging") in the same
 * transaction that schedules its drain. The claim moves the user out of the
 * "deleted" bucket this index scans, so a later cron tick advances to the
 * next unclaimed users instead of re-selecting an in-flight one and
 * enqueuing a duplicate purgeUser chain. Convex schedules the drain
 * atomically with this commit, so a claimed user always has a worker.
