 * row, so removing the token would strand the stored titles and bodies. That
 * matters most on ownership transfer, where the incoming profile registers the
 * same token and would otherwise be handed the previous owner's history.
 *
 * The clear runs through the same `canPrunePushHistory` veto as registration,
 * for the same reason: the component's delete takes in-flight rows with it, and
 * a sender that comes back to a missing document throws, rolling back the state
 * patches for up to 99 other users batched with it. Vetoing here does strand
 * this device's bodies for good — there is no next launch to retry on — but a
 * handful of orphaned rows in the rare in-flight case beats breaking somebody
 * else's batch.
 *
 * ponytail: the component clears 1000 notifications per call and reschedules
 * for the rest, but that continuation resolves through the token row removed
 * here, so a device holding more leaves the remainder orphaned. Registration
 * pruning keeps histories far below 1000; drain in a loop if it ever doesn't.
