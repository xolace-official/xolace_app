 * reaped by the 180-day `lastRegisteredAt` clock rather than by a delivery

 * watchdog still holds makes its state patch hit a missing document and throw,
 * taking the bookkeeping for up to 99 other users in the same batch down with
 * it. On registration refusing costs nothing — the next one tries again. On
 * device removal it strands that device's bodies permanently, and that is still
 * the better trade.
 *
 * The quiet window is measured from *our previous observation*, not from
 * `_creationTime`. `_creationTime` is when a row was queued, and the write we
 * are racing is scheduled off the send: a row that waited behind a backlog, or
 * came back through `needs_retry`, enters `delivered` already older than the
 * settle window, so an age gate on it lets the delete through while that send's
 * watchdog is still pending. An unchanged fingerprint across the window is the
 * only evidence available here that nothing is still writing — the component
 * stores no per-state timestamp.
 *
 * The cost is that pruning takes two registrations: the first stamps, the second
 * clears. App launches supply those, and a device that never launches again is
 * a device whose history nobody is reading.
 *
 * ponytail: an unfinished row older than the read window is invisible here. It
 * would have to sit behind a full window of newer notifications, and the
 * component retries `needs_retry` continuously, so that means genuinely stuck.
