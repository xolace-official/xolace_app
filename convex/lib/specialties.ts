/**
 * What a xolacer is here for — a fixed, self-declared taxonomy, never free
 * text. Free text would let a volunteer advertise "depression" or "trauma" on
 * a profile the app can't stand behind, and it makes the roster's filter chips
 * impossible.
 *
 * The list deliberately stops short of clinical territory: no depression, no
 * trauma, no addiction. Advertising a peer volunteer as a specialist in those
 * invites exactly the conversations the escalation exclusion exists to keep
 * out.
 *
 * `label` is the compact chip (roster rows, profile); `pickerLabel` is the
 * fuller phrasing used in the setup list, where there's room to be specific;
 * `listensTo` completes "<name> listens to ___." on the session-end
 * suggestion card — a statement about what the xolacer declared, never a
 * claim about the person reading it.
 * Shared by the Convex validator and the app so the picker, the chips and the
 * filter can never drift apart.
