// =============================================================
// EPISODIC MEMORY RELEVANCE FEEDBACK — Phase 4, Loop #3.
//
// Pure math for the salience weight of an episodic memory. A memory's
// weight rises when a LATER session's mirror lands with it in context,
// and falls when that mirror is given up on. The weight is mirrored into
// the RAG vector's native `importance` (0–1), which scales the memory's
// search score — so what keeps helping surfaces more, and what keeps
// missing sinks.
//
// Why a stored weight instead of reading the vector: @convex-dev/rag 0.7.5
// has NO in-place importance setter. `entryIsSame` treats an importance
// change as a different entry, so every adjustment re-embeds the composite
// (an embedding call). We therefore keep the running weight in
// `emotional_metadata.episodicImportance` — cheap, transactional, and
// durable across re-ingestion — and only pay the re-embed to apply it.
//
// FLOOR, not zero: feedback nudges salience; it never erases a memory.
// A memory that keeps missing decays toward MIN_IMPORTANCE (still
// retrievable, just deprioritized), never to 0 (which would make it
// invisible — that is deletion's job, not feedback's).
