# Expo Audio (expo-audio)

A library that provides an API to implement audio playback and recording in apps.
Android, iOS, tvOS, Web, Included in Expo Go

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Use this file to discover all available pages.

`expo-audio` is a cross-platform audio library for accessing the native audio capabilities of the device.

The [Android media format support documentation](https://developer.android.com/media/media3/exoplayer/supported-formats) covers formats supported when using Expo Player on Android. The [iOS audio and video format documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudiotypes/audio-format-identifiers) lists supported media formats for Apple devices.

Note that audio automatically stops if headphones/Bluetooth audio devices are disconnected.

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npx expo install expo-audio

# yarn
yarn expo install expo-audio

# pnpm
pnpm expo install expo-audio

# bun
bun expo install expo-audio
```

If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-audio` using its built-in [config plugin](/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

### Example app.json with config plugin

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone.",
          "enableBackgroundPlayback": true,
          "enableBackgroundRecording": false
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | Only for: iOS. A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message. Setting it to `false` will disable the permission. |
| `recordAudioAndroid` | `true` | Only for: Android. A boolean that determines whether to enable the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android. |
| `enableBackgroundRecording` | `false` | A boolean that determines whether to enable background audio recording. On Android, this adds a recording foreground service and permissions and displays a persistent notification during recording. On iOS, this adds the `audio` background mode. **Note:** Background recording can significantly impact battery life. |
| `enableBackgroundPlayback` | `true` | A boolean that determines whether to enable background audio playback. On Android, this adds a media playback foreground service and allows you to display the lockscreen controls and is required for sustained background playback. On iOS, this adds the `audio` background mode. |

## Usage

### Playing sounds

```jsx
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

const audioSource = require('./assets/Hello.mp3');

export default function App() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(audioSource);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Play Sound" onPress={() => player.play()} />
      <Button
        title="Replay Sound"
        onPress={() => {
          player.seekTo(0);
          player.play();
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Recording sounds

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import {
  useAudioRecorder,
  AudioModule,
  RecordingPresets,
  setAudioModeAsync,
  useAudioRecorderState,
} from 'expo-audio';

export default function App() {
  const audioRecorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
  const recorderState = useAudioRecorderState(audioRecorder);

  const record = async () => {
    await audioRecorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
    audioRecorder.record();
  };

  const stopRecording = async () => {
    // The recording will be available on `audioRecorder.uri`.
    await audioRecorder.stop();
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const status = await AudioModule.requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      if (!status.granted) {
        Alert.alert('Permission to access microphone was denied');
      }

      setAudioModeAsync({
        playsInSilentMode: true,
        allowsRecording: true,
      });
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button
        title={recorderState.isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'}
        onPress={recorderState.isRecording ? stopRecording : record}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Playing audio in the background

Background audio playback allows your app to continue playing audio when it moves to the background or when the device screen locks.

#### Configuration

To enable background audio playback, use the config plugin in your [app config](/workflow/configuration):

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "enableBackgroundPlayback": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The above configuration automatically configures the required native settings:

-   Android Adds `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permissions. Also declares a media playback foreground service (`AudioControlsService`) in app's **AndroidManifest.xml**.
-   iOS Adds the `audio` `UIBackgroundMode` capability

#### Usage

After configuring your app with the config plugin, you need to:

1.  **Configure the audio session** to allow background playback
2.  **Enable lock screen controls** (required on Android for sustained background playback)

```jsx
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAudioPlayer, setAudioModeAsync } from 'expo-audio';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function AudioPlayerScreen() {
  const audioSource = require('./assets/audio.mp3');
  const player = useAudioPlayer(audioSource);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Configure audio session for background playback
    setAudioModeAsync({
      playsInSilentMode: true,
      shouldPlayInBackground: true,
      interruptionMode: 'doNotMix',
    });
  }, []);

  const handlePlay = () => {
    // Enable lock screen controls with metadata
    player.setActiveForLockScreen(true, {
      title: 'My Audio Title',
      artist: 'Artist Name',
      albumTitle: 'Album Name',
      artworkUrl: 'https://example.com/artwork.jpg', // optional
    });

    // Start playback - this will continue in the background
    player.play();
  };

  const handleStop = () => {
    player.pause();
    // Optionally disable lock screen controls when done
    player.setActiveForLockScreen(false);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Play" onPress={handlePlay} />
      <Button title="Stop" onPress={handleStop} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
Android

> **Note**: On Android, you have to enable the lock screen controls with [`setActiveForLockScreen`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/audio#setactiveforlockscreenactive-metadata-options) for sustained background playback. Otherwise, the audio will stop after approximately 3 minutes of background playback (OS limitation). Ensure to appropriately [configure the config plugin](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/audio#configuration-in-app-config).

-   A media notification appears in the notification drawer with playback controls
-   Audio continues playing indefinitely in the background
-   Users can control playback from the lock screen and notification
-   The foreground service keeps the playback alive during playback
iOS

On iOS, audio playback continues seamlessly in the background once the audio session is configured with `shouldPlayInBackground: true`. Lock screen controls are optional but enhance the user experience by providing playback controls on the lock screen and Control Center.

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure the following for background playback:

-   For Android, add to **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
    
    <application>
      <!-- Other application components -->
      <service
        android:name="expo.modules.audio.service.AudioControlsService"
        android:exported="false"
        android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback">
        <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="androidx.media3.session.MediaSessionService" />
        </intent-filter>
      </service>
    </application>
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add to **ios/YourApp/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
      <string>audio</string>
    </array>
    ```

### Recording audio in the background

> Background recording can significantly impact battery life. Only enable it when necessary for your app's functionality.

Background audio recording allows your app to continue recording when it moves to the background or when the device screen locks.

To enable background recording, use the config plugin in your [app config](/workflow/configuration):

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to record audio.",
          "enableBackgroundRecording": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The above configuration automatically configures the required native settings:

-   Android Adds `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`, and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permissions. Also declares an audio recording foreground service in app's **AndroidManifest.xml**.
-   iOS Adds the `audio` `UIBackgroundMode` capability

Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure the following permissions in your native projects:

-   For Android, add to **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:
    
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
    ```
    
-   For iOS, add to **ios/YourApp/Info.plist**:
    
    ```xml
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
      <string>audio</string>
    </array>
    ```

#### Usage

After configuring your app, enable background recording at runtime using [`setAudioModeAsync`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/audio#audiosetaudiomodeasyncmode):

```jsx
import { setAudioModeAsync, useAudioRecorder, RecordingPresets } from 'expo-audio';

await setAudioModeAsync({
  playsInSilentMode: true,
  allowsRecording: true,
  allowsBackgroundRecording: true,
});

const recorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
await recorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
await recorder.record();

// Recording continues in background
```
Android

On Android, background recording requires a foreground service, which displays a persistent notification with the text "Recording audio" and a stop button. This notification cannot be dismissed while recording is active and automatically disappears when recording stops.
iOS

On iOS, background recording continues seamlessly when the app is in the background or the screen locks. No additional notifications or indicators are shown to the app user beyond the system status bar.

### Using the AudioPlayer directly

In most cases, use the [`useAudioPlayer`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/audio#useaudioplayersource-options) hook to create an `AudioPlayer` instance. It manages the player's lifecycle and ensures proper disposal when the component unmounts. However, in some advanced use cases, you may need to create an `AudioPlayer` that persists beyond the component's lifecycle. In those cases, use the [`createAudioPlayer`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/audio#audiocreateaudioplayersource-options) function. You need to be aware of the risks that come with this approach, as it is your responsibility to call the [`release()`](/versions/v55.0.0/sdk/expo#release) method when the player is no longer needed. If not handled properly, this approach may lead to memory leaks.

```tsx
import { createAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';
const player = createAudioPlayer(audioSource);
```

### Notes on web usage

-   A MediaRecorder issue on Chrome produces WebM files missing the duration metadata. [See the open Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=642012).
-   MediaRecorder encoding options and other configurations are inconsistent across browsers. Using a polyfill such as [kbumsik/opus-media-recorder](https://github.com/kbumsik/opus-media-recorder) or [ai/audio-recorder-polyfill](https://github.com/ai/audio-recorder-polyfill) in your application will improve your experience. Any options passed to `prepareToRecordAsync` will be passed directly to the MediaRecorder API and as such the polyfill.
-   Web browsers require sites to be served securely for them to listen to a mic. See [MediaDevices `getUserMedia()` security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#security) for more details.

## Hooks

### `useAudioPlayer(source, options)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source`(optional) | [AudioSource](#audiosource) | The audio source to load. Can be a local asset via `require()`, a remote URL, or null for no initial source. Default: `null` |
| `options`(optional) | [AudioPlayerOptions](#audioplayeroptions) | Audio player configuration options. Default: `{}` |

  

Creates an `AudioPlayer` instance that automatically releases when the component unmounts.

This hook manages the player's lifecycle and ensures it's properly disposed when no longer needed. The player will start loading the audio source immediately upon creation.

Returns: `AudioPlayer`

An `AudioPlayer` instance that's automatically managed by the component lifecycle.

Example

```tsx
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

function MyComponent() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(require('./sound.mp3'));

  return (
    <Button title="Play" onPress={() => player.play()} />
  );
}
```

Example

```tsx
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

function MyComponent() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer('https://example.com/audio.mp3', {
    updateInterval: 1000,
    downloadFirst: true,
  });

  return (
    <Button title="Play" onPress={() => player.play()} />
  );
}
```

### `useAudioPlayerStatus(player)`

| `statusListener`(optional) | (status: [RecordingStatus](#recordingstatus)) => void | Optional callback function that receives recording status updates. |

  

Hook that creates an `AudioRecorder` instance for recording audio.

This hook manages the recorder's lifecycle and ensures it's properly disposed when no longer needed. The recorder is automatically prepared with the provided options and can be used to record audio.

Returns: `AudioRecorder`

An `AudioRecorder` instance that's automatically managed by the component lifecycle.

Example

```tsx
import { useAudioRecorder, RecordingPresets } from 'expo-audio';

function RecorderComponent() {
  const recorder = useAudioRecorder(
    RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY,
    (status) => console.log('Recording status:', status)
  );

  const startRecording = async () => {
    await recorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
    recorder.record();
  };

  return (
    <Button title="Start Recording" onPress={startRecording} />
  );
}
```

### `useAudioRecorderState(recorder, interval)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recorder` | [AudioRecorder](#audiorecorder) | The `AudioRecorder` instance to monitor. |
| `interval`(optional) | `number` | How often (in milliseconds) to poll the recorder's status. Defaults to 500ms. Default: `500` |

  

Hook that provides real-time recording state updates for an `AudioRecorder`.

This hook polls the recorder's status at regular intervals and returns the current recording state. Use this when you need to monitor the recording status without setting up a status listener.

Returns: `RecorderState`

The current `RecorderState` containing recording information.

Example

```tsx
import { useAudioRecorder, useAudioRecorderState, RecordingPresets } from 'expo-audio';

function RecorderStatusComponent() {
  const recorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
  const state = useAudioRecorderState(recorder);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Recording: {state.isRecording ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
      <Text>Duration: {Math.round(state.durationMillis / 1000)}s</Text>
      <Text>Can Record: {state.canRecord ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### `useAudioSampleListener(player, listener)`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player` | [AudioPlayer](#audioplayer) | The `AudioPlayer` instance to sample audio from. |
| `listener` | (data: [AudioSample](#audiosample)) => void | Function called with each audio sample containing waveform data. |

  

Hook that sets up audio sampling for an `AudioPlayer` and calls a listener with audio data.

This hook enables audio sampling on the player (if supported) and subscribes to audio sample updates. Audio sampling provides real-time access to audio waveform data for visualization or analysis.

> **Note:** Audio sampling requires `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android and is not supported on all platforms.

Returns: `void`

Example

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useAudioPlayer, useAudioSampleListener, requestRecordingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-audio';

function AudioVisualizerComponent() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(require('./music.mp3'));

  // if required on Android, request recording permissions
  useEffect(() => {
    async function requestPermission() {
      const { granted } = await requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      if (granted) {
        console.log("Permission granted");
      }
    }

    requestPermission();
   }, []);

  useAudioSampleListener(player, (sample) => {
    // Use sample.channels array for audio visualization
    console.log('Audio sample:', sample.channels[0].frames);
  });

  return <AudioWaveform player={player} />;
}
```

Example

```tsx
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

export default function App() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(source);

  // Normal playback speed
  player.playbackRate = 1.0;

  // Slow motion (half speed)
  player.playbackRate = 0.5;

  // Fast playback (1.5x speed)
  player.playbackRate = 1.5;

  // Maximum speed on mobile
  player.playbackRate = 2.0;
}
```

### `AudioMode`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| allowsBackgroundRecording(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS. Whether audio recording should continue when the app moves to the background. Default: `false` |
| allowsRecording(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: iOS. Whether the audio session allows recording. Default: `false` |
| interruptionMode(optional) | [InterruptionMode](#interruptionmode) | Determines how the audio session interacts with other audio sessions.
-   `'doNotMix'`: Requests exclusive audio focus. Other apps will pause their audio.
-   `'duckOthers'`: Requests audio focus with ducking. Other apps lower their volume but continue playing.
-   `'mixWithOthers'`: Audio plays alongside other apps without interrupting them. On Android, this means no audio focus is requested. Best suited for sound effects, UI feedback, or short audio clips.

. Default: `'mixWithOthers'` |
| interruptionModeAndroid(optional) | [InterruptionModeAndroid](#interruptionmodeandroid) | Deprecated: Use interruptionMode instead, which now works on both platforms. . Supported platforms: Android. Determines how the audio session interacts with other sessions on Android. |
| playsInSilentMode(optional) | `boolean` | Determines if audio playback is allowed when the device is in silent mode. On Android, when `false`, playback is suppressed when the ringer mode is silent or vibrate. Default: `true` |
| shouldPlayInBackground(optional) | `boolean` | Whether the audio session stays active when the app moves to the background. Note: On Android, you have to enable the lockscreen controls with setActiveForLockScreen for sustained background playback. Otherwise, the audio will stop after approximately 3 minutes of background playback (OS limitation). Make sure to also appropriately configure the config-plugin. Default: `false` |
| shouldRouteThroughEarpiece(optional) | `boolean` | Whether the audio should route through the earpiece. On iOS, this only has an effect when `allowsRecording` is `true` (i.e., the audio session category is `.playAndRecord`). When `false` (the default), audio is routed through the speaker. Default: `false` |

### `AudioPlayerOptions`

Supported platforms: Android, iOS, tvOS, Web.

Options for configuring audio player behavior.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| crossOrigin(optional) | `'anonymous' | 'use-credentials'` | Supported platforms: Web. Determines the [cross origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/crossorigin) used by the underlying native view on web. If `undefined` (default), does not use CORS at all. If set to `'anonymous'`, the audio will be loaded with CORS enabled. Note that some audio may not play if CORS is enabled, depending on the CDN settings. If you encounter issues, consider adjusting the `crossOrigin` property. Default: `undefined` |
| downloadFirst(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS, Web. If set to `true`, the system will attempt to download the resource to the device before loading. This value defaults to `false`. Works with:
-   Local assets from `require('path/to/file')`
-   Remote HTTP/HTTPS URLs
-   Asset objects

. When enabled, this ensures the audio file is fully downloaded before playback begins. This can improve playback performance and reduce buffering, especially for users managing multiple audio players simultaneously. On Android and iOS, this will download the audio file to the device's tmp directory before playback begins. The system will purge the file at its discretion. On web, this will download the audio file to the user's device memory and make it available for the user to play. The system will usually purge the file from memory after a reload or on memory pressure. On web, CORS restrictions apply to the blob url, so you need to make sure the server returns the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. |
| keepAudioSessionActive(optional) | `boolean` | Supported platforms: iOS. If set to `true`, the audio session will not be deactivated when this player pauses or finishes playback. This prevents interrupting other audio sources (like videos) when the audio ends. Useful for sound effects that should not interfere with ongoing video playback or other audio. The audio session for this player will not be deactivated automatically when the player finishes playback. Note: If needed, you can manually deactivate the audio session using setIsAudioActiveAsync(false). Default: `false` |
| preferredForwardBufferDuration(optional) | `number` | Supported platforms: Android, iOS. The duration in seconds the player should buffer ahead of the current playback position. A higher value improves playback stability at the cost of more memory/network usage.

-   **iOS**: Maps to `AVPlayerItem.preferredForwardBufferDuration`. A value of `0` lets the system decide.
-   **Android**: Configures ExoPlayer's `DefaultLoadControl` max buffer duration.
-   **Web**: Not applicable (browser manages buffering).
