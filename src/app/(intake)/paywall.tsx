/**
 * The intake offer screen (T4, issue #235) — step 4 of intake, fired once at
 * session 0, right after Q11.
 *
 * Strictly an offer, not a checkout: there is no price on this screen and no
 * package to select. "I'm ready" pushes the real paywall (`(intake)/plans`),
 * which is where pricing, the period picker and the store call live. Splitting
 * the two keeps the first-run pitch from opening on a number.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into `src/features/purchases/plus-offer-policy.ts`:
 * declining here is not a proactive-offer dismissal and must never spend the
 * dismissal budget. Do not connect them.
