/**
 * TextAnimation — the five ways a piece of text arrives.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <TextAnimation.Typing text="Everything ships with its accessibility done" />
 * <TextAnimation.Rotating text={['fast', 'native', 'yours']} />
 * <TextAnimation.Counting value={2048} />
 * <TextAnimation.Sliding value={price} decimals={2} />
 * <TextAnimation.Scrolling value={120} step={10} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why one component with five parts
 *
 * They are one idea — a value that changes and wants to be seen changing —
 * and they share every prop that says *how*: `duration`, `delay`, `loop`,
 * `enabled`. Put on the `TextAnimation` root, those become the defaults for
 * everything inside it, so a hero with three of these in it is configured once
 * rather than three times.
 *
 * ## What React Native forces
 *
 * Nested `Text` is the only thing that gets real line-breaking, and it cannot
 * be transformed — a `translateY` on it is ignored. So the two parts that
 * animate a whole string, `Typing` and `Counting`, stay real text and keep
 * wrapping; the three that slide glyphs past each other lay out as rows of
 * views, which buys the transform and costs line-breaking. None of the three
 * is ever a paragraph, so the trade only ever falls the right way.
 *
 * ## Why the digits are drawn rather than measured
 *
 * A number animated as React state is a re-render per frame. `Counting` runs
 * the value on the UI thread and only crosses back when the *rounded* number
 * changes, which for a whole number is a couple of dozen times rather than
 * sixty a second. The sliding and scrolling parts do not cross back at all:
 * every digit is already rendered, and the animation is a transform on a
 * column of them.
