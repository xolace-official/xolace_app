/**
 * ScrollHeader — a screen header that hands over to a compact bar as the page
 * scrolls.
 *
 * A screen with a title has two states and every app draws both: the title
 * large, at rest, with room around it, and the title small, pinned, once you
 * are reading. Hand-rolling the change between them is where screens stop
 * matching each other — one snaps, one crossfades at a different point, one
 * forgets the bar is over a safe area — so the two states and the transit
 * between them are one component here.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <ScrollHeader className="flex-1">
 *   <ScrollHeader.Bar>
 *     <ScrollHeader.Title>Library</ScrollHeader.Title>
 *     <ScrollHeader.Actions>
 *       <Button variant="ghost" size="icon"><SearchIcon size={18} /></Button>
 *     </ScrollHeader.Actions>
 *   </ScrollHeader.Bar>
 *   <ScrollHeader.Large>
 *     <ScrollHeader.Title>Library</ScrollHeader.Title>
 *     <ScrollHeader.Description>128 components</ScrollHeader.Description>
 *   </ScrollHeader.Large>
 *   <ScrollView>{rows}</ScrollView>
 * </ScrollHeader>
 * ```
 *
 * ## The band collapses; nothing inside it is animated up
 *
 * The header is one absolutely positioned band over the scroller, and the only
 * thing driven by the scroll is its height: `bar + max(0, large - offset)`.
 * The bar is anchored to its top and the large block to its bottom, so the
 * band shrinking is what carries the large block up and behind the bar, and
 * `overflow-hidden` is what cuts it off there.
 *
 * Driving the height rather than a `translateY` is what makes the rest fall
 * out for free. Over-scrolling makes `large - offset` larger than `large`, so
 * the band grows and a cover filling it stretches by being laid out bigger —
 * no scale transform, so a photograph stretches without going soft. And the
 * band's height is the inset the content needs, so there is one number rather
 * than two that have to agree.
 *
 * ## The two titles cross-fade; neither one morphs
 *
 * The large title and the bar title are separate elements that fade past each
 * other. A single title scaled and translated between the two positions tracks
 * beautifully until the text is long enough to truncate, at which point it is
 * animating between two different strings.
 *
 * Both are therefore in the tree at once, which is a problem for a screen
 * reader — one of them is invisible and would still be read. So the crossing
 * point is also published to React as `collapsed`, and whichever title is not
 * being shown is hidden from accessibility. That is one re-render per crossing
 * and no more: everything that runs per frame stays in shared values.
 *
 * ## The bar's surface is a fill, or a frost
 *
 * `surface` says what the bar is drawn on once it has taken over: a token
 * fill, nothing at all over a cover, or `blur` — a real material, so the rows
 * passing under the bar stay legible as shape and colour while losing the
 * detail that would compete with the title on top.
 *
 * The frost needs a native view, and there are two ways it cannot be drawn:
 * `expo-blur` is optional and may not be installed, and Reduce Transparency is
 * a preference that outranks the design. Both fall back to the plain
 * background token rather than to nothing, because a bar you cannot read is a
 * worse answer than a bar that is not frosted.
 *
 * ## What it needs
 *
 * A height to fill, and exactly one scrollable child. The child is cloned with
 * the scroll handler and the content inset composed onto it, the same way
 * `ScrollFade` wraps one, so a `ScrollView`, a `FlatList` or a `SectionList`
 * all work unchanged.
