/**
 * Tour — the walkthrough that introduces a screen one control at a time.
 *
 * An empty state explains a screen before there is anything on it; a tour
 * explains it once there is. It dims everything, cuts a hole around one control
 * and puts a card beside it, then moves the hole to the next control. What
 * makes that work is the hole: a caption alone has to describe where to look,
 * and "the button at the top right" is a sentence people read twice and still
 * get wrong.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Tour open={onboarding} onOpenChange={setOnboarding}>
 *   <Tour.Step order={0} title="Your library" description="Everything you save lands here.">
 *     <IconButton icon={<BookmarkIcon />} onPress={openLibrary} />
 *   </Tour.Step>
 *
 *   <Tour.Step order={1} title="Start writing" description="A new note, from anywhere." shape="circle">
 *     <Fab icon={<PlusIcon />} onPress={compose} />
 *   </Tour.Step>
 * </Tour>
 * ```
 *
 * A step wraps the control it is about, so the two live together in the tree
 * and cannot drift apart — a step whose target has been deleted goes with it
 * rather than pointing at empty space. `order` is what puts the steps in a
 * sequence, and it is the author's numbering rather than the tree's, because a
 * walkthrough usually crosses a header, a list and a tab bar in an order the
 * layout knows nothing about.
 *
 * The target is measured in window coordinates each time its step becomes
 * current, and again when the window changes size — a rect measured in portrait
 * describes nothing after a rotation, and a spotlight in the wrong place is
 * worse than none. A target that has scrolled out of view is the one case this
 * cannot fix by itself: bring it back with `onStepChange`, which fires with the
 * step about to be shown.
 *
 * The hole is one path with an even-odd fill — the screen rectangle and the
 * cutout in a single `d`, animated on the UI thread — rather than four views
 * arranged around a gap. Four views cannot have rounded corners between them,
 * and the corner is most of what makes the hole read as *this control* instead
 * of as a rectangle that happens to contain it.
