     * `writingDirection` is what closes that gap, and it also puts bidi
     * punctuation on the correct end of a mixed line.
     *

     * caller asked for, or unset. A component that centres its label means it
     * in both directions.

/**
 * Wraps the bare text among `children` so it can live in a plain view.
 *
 * React Native will not render a string outside a `<Text>`, and a component
 * that takes `children` has no say in whether it is handed one — so anything
 * putting `children` into a `View`, a `Pressable` or a scroller has to allow
 * for it. Every part in the library that does runs its children through here.
 *
 * Per child, and not all-or-nothing. A part is nearly always given an element
 * and some text together — an icon and a label, an arrow and a line of text —
 * which makes `children` an *array*, so a `typeof children === 'string'` check
 * never matches and the text underneath reaches the view bare. That is the
 * shape this exists to make impossible.
 *
 * `render` is there because the wrapper is rarely the plain default: a button
 * wants its own label variant, a sheet header wants a heading. Pass one, and
 * the text arrives dressed the way the part would have dressed it anyway.
