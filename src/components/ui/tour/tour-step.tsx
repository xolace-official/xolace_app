 * wrapper we own is guaranteed to be measurable. That wrapper is a plain view
 * with no sizing of its own, so it takes the width its parent gives it: put
 * layout classes on the step rather than on the child, the way you would on any
 * other view in that position.
 *
 * It renders its child and nothing else while the tour is closed, and stays
 * mounted either way — a step is a description of a control that is already on
 * the screen, not something that appears with the walkthrough.
