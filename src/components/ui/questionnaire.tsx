/**
 * Questionnaire — one question at a time, with progress, validation and a way
 * back.
 *
 * Unlike `Steps`, which reflects a flow the app owns, Questionnaire *owns* the
 * flow: it holds the answers, decides which question is current, gates the way
 * forward on the current one being answered, and reports the whole set back
 * when it is done. The caller supplies the questions and does something with
 * the answers; everything between those two points belongs here.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Questionnaire items={items} onSubmit={(answers) => save(answers)}>
 *   <Questionnaire.Title>Project setup</Questionnaire.Title>
 *   <Questionnaire.Progress />
 *   <Questionnaire.Item name="direction" required>
 *     <Questionnaire.Question>What should we build next?</Questionnaire.Question>
 *     <Questionnaire.Description>Choose one, or write your own.</Questionnaire.Description>
 *     <Questionnaire.Choices>
 *       <Questionnaire.Choice value="delegation" label="Delegation" />
 *       <Questionnaire.Choice value="prompts" label="Question prompts" />
 *       <Questionnaire.Input placeholder="Type another answer…" />
 *     </Questionnaire.Choices>
 *     <Questionnaire.Error />
 *   </Questionnaire.Item>
 *   <Questionnaire.Footer>
 *     <Questionnaire.Back />
 *     <Questionnaire.Next />
 *     <Questionnaire.Submit />
 *   </Questionnaire.Footer>
 * </Questionnaire>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why it draws no container of its own
 *
 * Upstream this rendered inside PanelUI's `Frame`. Xolace uses it full-bleed on
 * an intake screen, so the container came out: the root is a plain `View` that
 * takes a `className`, and the screen around it owns the horizontal insets, the
 * background and the safe area. The only shell left is the vertical rhythm and
 * the `overflow-hidden` the sliding question needs to be clipped by.
 *
 * ## Why the root reads its children instead of collecting registrations
 *
 * Only the active question is mounted, so an unmounted one cannot report that
 * it exists — and without knowing the full set there is no total to count
 * against, no "is this the last one", and no way to disable a question the
 * user has not reached. So the root inspects its children once per render and
 * reads `name`, `required`, `multiple` and `disabled` straight off the
 * elements. React elements carry their props before anything renders them,
 * which makes the whole set knowable without mounting any of it.
 *
 * That same pass sorts the parts into the shell: the title and progress go to
 * the header strip, the footer to a section at the bottom of the panel, and
 * everything else is a question.
 *
 * ## Answers are one record, the way a form would submit them
 *
 * `answers[name]` is a string for a single-answer question and an array for a
 * `multiple` one. A freeform answer lands under the same name — it is another
 * answer to the same question, not a separate field — which is why the text
 * input shows whatever value does not match one of the question's own choices.
 * Picking a choice and typing therefore replace each other, without either one
 * having to know the other exists.
 *
 * ## What blocks the way forward
 *
 * A required question blocks until it has an answer. An optional one never
 * blocks. `Questionnaire.Skip` does not unblock anything, then — it *records*
 * that the question was deliberately left out, moving its status from
 * `unanswered` to `skipped` so the app can tell the two apart. Making an
 * optional question demand an explicit skip would trap anyone who did not
 * render the Skip button, and a question that cannot be ignored is not
 * optional.
