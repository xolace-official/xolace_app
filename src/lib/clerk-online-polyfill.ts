/**
 * Force `navigator.onLine` to report online in React Native.
 *
 * Clerk's bundled JS gates JWT minting behind `isNavigatorOnline()`:
 *
 *   if (typeof navigator.onLine !== "boolean") return true; // undefined ⇒ online
 *   return !!navigator.onLine;                              // boolean false ⇒ OFFLINE
 *
 * In the production/Hermes runtime `navigator.onLine` can be defined as the
 * boolean `false` (not `undefined`), so Clerk concludes the device is offline
 * and `getToken({ template: "convex" })` throws `clerk_offline` on the *refresh*
 * path. The cached-token path skips this check, so the first token after a cold
 * start works and only the forced refresh fails — surfacing as a Clerk⇄Convex
 * auth desync that drops the user to the login screen.
 *
 * A previous guard only patched the `=== undefined` case, which misses the
 * boolean-`false` runtime. Override unconditionally so the check always passes.
 * React Native has no real online/offline signal here — Clerk added this purely
 * for web — so reporting "online" is always correct for this app.
 *
 * Imported for its side effect; must run before `@clerk/expo` is first used.
