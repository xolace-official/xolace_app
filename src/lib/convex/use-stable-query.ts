 * Drop-in replacement for `useQuery` for parametrized queries.

 * Unlike `useQuery`, this does not return `undefined` while reloading after the
 * query arguments change — it keeps returning the previously loaded data until
 * the new data finishes loading. This prevents subtrees guarded by `&& data`
 * from unmounting (and re-running mount animations) on every arg change.
 *
 * Use when the args to a query change in response to user interaction (paging,
 * filtering, switching tabs) and the transient `undefined` would blank/unmount
 * the UI. Prefer plain `useQuery` for queries whose args are stable — there the
 * only `undefined` is the genuine first-load state you want to show a skeleton
 * for.
 *

 * which blanks the list. This keeps returning the previously loaded page/status
 * until the new first page has finished loading, so the list stays put and
 * swaps in place.
 *
 * Use only when the paginated query's args change from user interaction. For a
 * plain infinite-scroll list with fixed args, use `usePaginatedQuery` directly.
