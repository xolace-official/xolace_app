/**
 * What a notification tap does — and how the tap reaches us at all.
 *
 * The delivery half is the bug this file exists for.
 * `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener` only fires for taps that happen
 * *while it is subscribed*. On a cold start the OS hands the launch tap to the
 * native module during startup, long before `(protected)` mounts — that layout
 * waits on fonts, Clerk, Convex auth and the intake-gate query, which on a cold
 * launch is seconds of network. By the time the listener subscribes the event
 * has been and gone, so the tap was silently dropped and the app just opened on
 * the home screen. Warm taps worked because the listener was already there,
 * which is why this looked like a cold-start-only bug.
 *
 * The launch tap survives in `getLastNotificationResponse()`, so subscribing
 * reads that first and dedupes it against the listener.
