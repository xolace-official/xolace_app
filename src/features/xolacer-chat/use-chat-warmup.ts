/**
 * Removes the two round trips a thread open used to pay for.
 *
 * The connection is the first: opening it here means the WS handshake overlaps
 * with the user reading their conversation list, instead of running after they
 * tap a row.
 *
 * The channel state is the second. The offline database is read first — the
 * last known state of every listed conversation lands in
 * `client.activeChannels` in one local read, so a row tapped before the socket
 * is up (or with no network at all) opens onto messages. `queryChannels` then
 * replaces it with live state once the connection is there; both hand the same
 * cached instance back to the `client.channel(...)` call in `ThreadMessages`,
 * so `useLocalChannelState` short-circuits and messages paint on the first
 * frame with no `watch()` of its own.
 *
 * It also populates every watched channel's unread count, and *that* needs
 * announcing. Stream dispatches `channels.queried` from inside `queryChannels`
 * — but before `hydrateActiveChannels` runs, so a listener that re-reads
 * `countUnread()` on it still sees zero. Rows have already subscribed by then
 * and nothing tells them to look again, which is why every unread badge was
 * blank until some unrelated re-render happened along. Re-announcing the same
 * event once the counts are actually there lands the badges on the first
 * paint. Deliberately sent through the client's own bus rather than a React
 * state bump: the rows read Stream's state through `useSyncExternalStore`, and
 * the React Compiler caches the list subtree on props that a hydration flag
 * would not be part of — the re-render would never reach them.
