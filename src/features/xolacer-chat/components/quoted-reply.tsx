/**
 * The quoted-reply preview — both the composer header ("Reply to …") and the
 * quote embedded in a sent bubble — sourced from the conversation rather than
 * from Stream's globally-shared user record. See `resolveMessageIdentity` for
 * why that record is never the right thing to show.
 *
 * Reply is reachable even though `minimalMessageActions` drops `quotedReply`:
 * the SDK's swipe-to-reply gesture (`enableSwipeToReply`, on by default) is a
 * second entry point that never passes through the action list. So the seeker
 * swiping on their xolacer's message got the pseudonym Stream holds for
 * everyone — "Reply to Camper KV7C" instead of the name in the header two
 * inches above it.
 *
 * The quoted message is resolved exactly as the SDK's own `Reply` does — prop
 * first (edit mode), then the message being rendered, then composer state —
 * and handed back as the `quotedMessage` prop, which is spread last inside
 * `Reply` and so wins over its own lookup. Delegating rather than
 * reimplementing keeps the layout, memoization, and the a11y announcement,
 * which reads the same patched message.
