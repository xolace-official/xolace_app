/**
 * The overflow menu for a xolacer — mounted in the thread and on the profile:
 * Report and Block, together on purpose, since someone reaching for one usually
 * wants the other.
 *
 * Block sits behind a confirmation because it cannot be undone — the server
 * refuses to reopen a conversation closed this way, and that refusal is the
 * point. The confirmation says so out loud. Both roles get it: a xolacer's
 * only other exit stops working the moment they accept a request.
 *
 * Report opens the feedback tray in concern mode, carrying the subject's
 * profile id and — from a thread only — that conversation's id. A report from a
 * profile is about the person, not an exchange: the bio or the display name can
 * itself be what is being reported, and the profile is reachable from the
 * roster with no conversation at all. `origin` is what decides that, not the
 * presence of `conversationId`, which is also the block target. The display
 * name goes no further than the form's copy.
 *
 * Block is conditionally *mounted*, never `hidden`: a profile reached from the
 * roster may have no conversation row, and there is no channel and nothing to
 * escape. (A hidden toolbar item also leaves a transparent touch-eating band
 * across the top on Android.)
