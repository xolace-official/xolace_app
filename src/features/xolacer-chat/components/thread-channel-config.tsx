 * **The rule for anything added here:** any Stream component that renders a
 * user's name or image must be overridden with conversation-sourced identity.
 * The Stream user record is deliberately pseudonymous for everyone (see
 * `upsertStreamUsers` server-side), so it is never the right thing to show a
 * seeker — and it is one record per person, so it can't be. That still covers
 * read receipts and anything else that grows an avatar: enabling one without
 * an override leaks the wrong identity by default.
 *
 * **Registering the override is only half of it.** The other half is where the
 * override sources its answer: it must ask `resolveMessageIdentity` whether
 * the sender *is* the counterpart, and take the name it returns. An override
 * that decides for itself — typically by asking whether the sender is someone
 * other than the local user — reintroduces the exact leak this map exists to

/**
 * Edit used to be wrapped here in a two-frame `requestAnimationFrame` delay on

 * and **zero** on iOS, and Edit is the one action that focuses the composer.
 *
 * The symptom that wrapper was written for — Edit silently doing nothing — was
 * actually the broken clipboard handler in stream-chat-expo < 9.7.3 poisoning
 * the overlay's action queue (see docs/bug-log.md, 2026-08-17). With that fixed,
 * Edit was verified working on iOS 26 without the delay: cold, and immediately
 * after a Copy tap. Stream's own `useAfterKeyboardOpenCallback` already holds
 * `setEditingState` until the composer's keyboard event lands, which is the
 * window that actually matters.
 *
 * If Edit ever regresses on iOS — keyboard flashing shut on open, or a JSI
 * abort (`Assertion failed: (isObject()), getObject`) from a focus command
 * reaching a shadow node mid-reparent — that delay is the thing to reinstate.
 *
 * `flagMessage` keeps the SDK's gating (never on your own message, only with
 * the capability) but not its handler: Stream's default alerts and flags into
 * a dashboard queue alone, while ours also writes the concern tray — see
 * `useFlagMessage`. Same `actionType`, so the SDK's icon and ordering stay.
