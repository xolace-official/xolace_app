/**
 * Live unread count for a `ConversationRow`. Reads `channel.countUnread()`,
 * which is only meaningful once the channel has been watched — the Connect
 * tab's `useChatWarmup` watches the most recent conversations in bulk (up to
 * its prefetch cap, see there) before any row renders, and announces itself
 * when that lands so rows re-read. Passive: doesn't call
 * `useStreamConnection`, so a row never opens the socket itself.
 *
 * `countUnread()` reads mutable state Stream owns, not React state —
 * `useSyncExternalStore` re-derives it on every event instead of mirroring it
 * into `useState` via an effect, so there's no seed/reset call to keep in sync
 * by hand. Stream updates channel state *before* it notifies listeners, so the
 * value read here is never one event stale.
 *
 * Subscribed at the client, not the channel, and to everything rather than to
 * a hand-picked list. Three real paths never reach a channel listener at all:
 * a read on another device (the clearing event carries no channel id, so it is
 * dispatched to client listeners only), a truncated history, and a new message
 * in a channel this client isn't watching (which arrives in notification
 * form). The snapshot is a field read and React bails out when the number is
 * unchanged, so the breadth costs a comparison per event.
