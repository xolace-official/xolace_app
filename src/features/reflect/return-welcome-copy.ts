/**
 * Copy for the Return Welcome sheet — a one-shot greeting shown the first time
 * a lapsed user reopens the app after their streak window expired.
 *
 * Intent: acknowledge that the app *knows* them and knows they were away, then
 * warmly encourage them back in. Not guilt, not indifference — recognition.
 * The longer the gap, the more the wording leans into "glad you walked back."
 *
 * Varies by gap, mirroring the inline header tiers in quiet-return-copy.ts:
 *   recent        — returning, but under 14 days
 *   away-14-30    — a couple of weeks
 *   away-30-90    — a month-plus
 *   away-90-plus  — months
 *   anniversary   — one year since first session
 *
 * The mascot points down toward this copy — it should read as "come sit",
 * a hand reaching back toward the fire.
