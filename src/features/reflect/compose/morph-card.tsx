 * runs a single spring that rotates it upright and grows it from the header
 * down to the top of the keyboard, where it is the composer. Nothing mounts or
 * unmounts across that — `progress` is the only difference between the two
 * readings, which is what keeps it feeling like the page opened rather than
 * like a screen was replaced.
