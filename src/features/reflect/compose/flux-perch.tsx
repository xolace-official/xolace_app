 * He is one image doing two jobs: at rest he leans on the page and whispers at
 * it, and as the card takes over he scales and fades into the presence dot the
 * composer already had. The dot is drawn by the card; Flux simply disappears
 * into where it will be, which is why both read this screen's geometry.
 *
 * The breathing loop is transform-only and pauses while the card is expanding
 * or expanded — a loop running underneath the morph spring is the classic way
 * to lose frames on the most-opened screen in the app.
