/**
 * The fire is not a per-slide illustration, it is ONE continuous thing the
 * deck moves over. Mounted once, behind every beat, with the carousel acting
 * as a camera — the fire drops and dims when the words need the screen, and
 * flares back when the beat is about the fire staying lit. Nothing cuts, so
 * the deck reads as one place rather than six pages about a place.
 *
 * It is also the cheap version: one decode, one texture, one loop for the
 * whole deck instead of six mounts.
 *
 * FRAMING, keyed to `STORY_BEATS` order:
 *   0 dusk      close and large — the fire is the subject
 *   1 mirror    lowest + dimmest — the beat is about reading words back, so
 *               the words own the screen
 *   2 vent      settles and holds, still lit — you are speaking INTO the fire,
 *               so it has to be present rather than dimmed away
 *   3 proof     returns to mid; the beat is about other fires out there
 *   4 xolacers  mid, steady
 *   5 plus      flares, brightest — "the fire stays lit"
 *
 * The fire composites ONTO the dawn arc behind it (`SkyArc`), so the sky lifts
 * across the six beats while the fire stays the light source.
