/**
 * The Vent beat — the second half of the Mirror/Vent pair, and built as its
 * deliberate inversion.
 *
 *     ⌁ VENT
 *     the line
 *     the aside
 *     EITHER ONE · ANY TIME
 *            ˙ ·  ˙        ← the breath, rising and gone
 *          ·
 *     [figure]             ← pushed LEFT of the text axis
 *
 * What makes the pair say "alternatives, not steps":
 *
 * 1. MIRRORED MASS. The Mirror's figure sits right of the text axis; this one
 *    sits left. Swiping between them flips the character across the axis
 *    instead of marching it forward.
 *
 * 2. REVERSED EMISSION. The Mirror sends the character DOWN into a reflection.
 *    Vent sends it UP into air. Same character, opposite direction — which is
 *    the difference between the two features stated as motion.
 *
 * 3. NO WATERLINE. The Mirror needs a surface, because a surface is what gives
 *    something back. Vent has none on purpose: there is nothing here to catch
 *    what you let go of, and the missing rule is that promise drawn. The sparks
 *    dissolve into the gap rather than landing anywhere. See `vent-sparks.tsx`.
 *
 * The plume drifts right rather than straight up so it fills the empty quadrant
 * the left-anchored figure opens, and so it never climbs through the copy.
 *
 * The fire, sky and scrims belong to `HearthBackdrop` and are untouched here.

 * coloured spark drawn over the character's own peach-lit face is invisible.
 * Started at the mouth, the first ~100pt of every spark's climb was spent
 * crossing the head, so the only ones that ever showed against the dark were
 * the ones that had already faded out. Starting clear of the silhouette puts
 * the whole plume on the background it was drawn to be seen against, and it
