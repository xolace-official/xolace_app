/**
 * The breath leaving the character on the Vent beat: a slow plume of embers
 * that rises, drifts right, and is gone before it reaches the copy.
 *
 * THE VANISHING IS THE PROMISE. The beat says nothing is stored and it goes
 * when you close it — so nothing here is allowed to arrive anywhere. Every
 * spark fades to zero mid-flight. If one ever lands on the text the slide is
 * saying the opposite of the words above it.
 *
 * NOT `features/vent/particles/ParticleField`, deliberately. That one is a
 * full-screen Skia canvas driven by `useFrameCallback` and the vent ritual's
 * stage machine (mic metering, compress, burn). It redraws every frame for as
 * long as it is mounted, and this deck keeps all seven slides mounted inside a
 * carousel — it would burn frames behind six slides nobody is looking at. It
 * also has no notion of a plume from a point, which is the only thing needed
 * here. Eighteen transform-only views cost nothing by comparison.
 *
 * Jitter comes from a fixed table rather than `Math.random()`: a random value
 * read during render would reshuffle the plume on every re-render.
