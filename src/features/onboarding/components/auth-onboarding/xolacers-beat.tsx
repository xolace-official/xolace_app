/**
 * The Xolacers beat — the deck's fourth bespoke composition, and the only one
 * where a second person is present.

 *     the line
 *     the aside
 *     TRAINED PEERS · NOT THERAPISTS
 *
 *          [figure, mask in hand]        ·   ← their ember, at eye height
 *                    ↑ warmth arrives on the face, after the ember does
 *
 * THE MASK STAYS IN THE HAND. It would have been easy to fade it out and call
 * that the transformation — and it would have said the opposite of the beat.
 * The promise here is that you can stop performing WITHOUT being identified:
 * the mask comes down, but you keep hold of it. The asset is used exactly as
 * drawn for that reason; nothing is animated off the character.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE MEANING. Their ember arrives first, the warmth on the face
 * lands ~420ms later. That gap is the whole slide: it is cause and effect, not
 * two things fading in. Play them together and it reads as a lighting choice.
 *
 * WHY THE CHARACTER IS CENTRED. Mirror pushes its figure right of the text
 * axis, Vent pushes it left; that flip is what tells you those two are
 * alternatives rather than steps (see the pair note in `story-beats.ts`). This
 * beat must not join that argument, so it sits on the axis and lets the empty
 * quadrant to its right belong to somebody else.
 *
 * The fire, sky and scrims belong to `HearthBackdrop` and are untouched here.
