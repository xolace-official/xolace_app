/**
 * The proof beat's visual: a dark field with one ember in it for every person
 * who sat with the same feeling this week.

 *
 * THE COUNT IS THE PICTURE, NOT A CAPTION ON ONE. A card that says "22 campers"
 * asks you to believe a number. Twenty-two lights in the dark ARE twenty-two —
 * countable, and the same claim made in a form that cannot be inflated. This is
 * the one place in the deck where the artifact and the statistic are the same
 * object, so `count` drives the geometry directly and nothing else may.
 *
 * THEY ARRIVE IN DEPTH BANDS, NOT ALL AT ONCE. Three layers light ~200ms apart,
 * far and dim first, near and bright last. A single fade reads as a texture
 * switching on; staggered by depth it reads as a field that goes back further
 * than the screen — which is the actual feeling being sold, that there are more
 * of these than you can see.
 *
 * WHY A JITTERED GRID AND NOT RANDOM POINTS. True random clumps, and a clump
 * looks like a group — which on this beat would say something we do not mean
 * (nobody here is together). One ember per cell with a deterministic offset
 * keeps them evenly alone. Deterministic, so the constellation is the same on
 * every render and never flickers into a new arrangement mid-swipe.
 *
 * ONE OF THEM SPEAKS. `VOICED` is held out of the scatter and drawn larger with
 * a halo; the beat hangs a real review off it. It sits low and left so the
 * quote can drop straight down from it without crossing the field.
