 * Says out loud what a dead socket otherwise says silently.

 * `streamStatus` only reports how the *connection attempt* went; once it
 * reaches `ready` the thread looks identical whether the socket is alive or
 * has since dropped, and a send just fails. This reads the live state instead.
 *
 * Sits directly above the composer rather than in the header, because
 * `useChatContext` throws outside a mounted `<Chat>` — which is every frame
 * before the client connects, and every `requested` thread, neither of which
 * mounts this component at all.
 *
 * Renders nothing while `isOnline` is `null`: that is Stream's "haven't asked
 * NetInfo yet" value, and treating it as offline would flash the strip on
 * every open. `connectionRecovering` separates a retrying socket from a flat
 * one — the difference decides whether waiting is worth it.

 * which is why the stock one flashes "Reconnecting…" over the top of the list
