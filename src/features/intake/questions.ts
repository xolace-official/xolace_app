/**
 * The intake questionnaire, as data (T1, issue #232 · T2, issue #233).
 *
 * Question text, option labels and enum values are the T1 resolution table
 * verbatim — this file is the single place they live, so the screen renders
 * them and never restates them. The two interstitials are not here — they
 * carry no answer and no enum, so their copy lives with the screen that says
 * it (`questionnaire/interstitials.tsx`). Values are the
 * `intakeAnswerValidators` enums
 * (`convex/lib/validators.ts`), which is what lets an answer go to
 * `intake.complete` untranslated.
 *
 * "I'd rather not say" is a real last option with the same tap target, and it
 * appears only where T1 says it does — Q2, Q3, Q4, Q6, Q8. Q5 and Q7 already
 * carry a native neutral ("depends on the day", "Not sure") and get no second
 * escape hatch.
