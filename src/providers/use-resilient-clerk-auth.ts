 * its client can mint a token, so Convex's single init token fetch fails and
 * Convex reports unauthenticated (it does NOT retry the initial fetch), dropping
 * the still-signed-in user to the auth screen. We retry `getToken` here while
 * Clerk still claims a session, so Convex's init fetch resolves to a real token.
 * While we retry, Convex stays `isLoading`, so the app shows the loader instead of
 * flashing auth.
 *
 * `getToken` MUST keep a stable identity — `ConvexProviderWithClerk` keys its
 * `fetchAccessToken` (and the `setAuth` effect) on it, so a new identity each
 * render would churn re-auth. We hold the live Clerk callbacks in refs and expose
 * one `useCallback([])`-stable wrapper (documented React Compiler exception).
